### 3. Detailed Network Design Plan

#### A. Scalability to Support Future Growth
- **Core Network Architecture:**  
  Deploy Cisco Catalyst 9500 Series switches to provide high performance and scalability, ensuring the network can support future growth.
- **Wireless Infrastructure:**  
  Use Aruba Wi-Fi 6 Access Points, offering sufficient wireless bandwidth and capacity to handle an increasing number of devices in the future.
- **Reserved Capacity:**  
  Reserve 30% additional bandwidth and ports in both core and access layers to accommodate future expansion without replacing key infrastructure.

#### B. Enhanced Security Measures
- **Firewall Deployment:**  
  Deploy Fortinet FortiGate 200E firewalls, providing advanced threat protection, traffic filtering, intrusion detection, antivirus, and ransomware defense.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  
  Utilize Cisco Secure IPS for real-time threat monitoring and mitigation.  
  Integrate threat intelligence updates to ensure the latest security rules are applied automatically.
- **Centralized Security Management:**  
  Leverage Palo Alto Panorama for centralized firewall policy management, reducing configuration errors and streamlining security operations.
- **Endpoint Protection:**  
  Implement CrowdStrike Falcon for advanced endpoint security, protecting up to 50 user devices, including those of remote workers.
  
#### C. High-Speed Wired and Wireless Connectivity
- **Core and Access Layers:**  
  Core network employs Cisco Catalyst 9500 Series switches, providing up to 10/40 Gbps high-speed connections.  
  Aruba 2930M switches are deployed in the access layer to deliver Gigabit Ethernet ports for high-speed device connectivity.
- **Wireless Coverage:**
  Deploy Aruba Wi-Fi 6 Access Points to ensure low latency, high bandwidth, and reliable wireless coverage.  
  Each access point supports up to 500 simultaneous users, meeting enterprise and guest connectivity requirements.

#### D. Redundancy Measures for Network Uptime
- **Link Redundancy:**  
  Utilize dual ISP connections to provide primary and backup links, ensuring seamless failover in case of link failure.
- **Device Redundancy:**  
  Core switches support VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), enabling active-standby router switching.  
  Deploy redundant switch links in the access layer to mitigate single points of failure.
- **Data Backup:**  
  Use Veeam Backup & Replication for regular backups of network configurations and data, ensuring quick recovery in case of disruptions.

#### E. Compliance with Industry Standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001)
- **Security Compliance:**  
  Deploy security tools such as Palo Alto Panorama and CrowdStrike Falcon to meet ISO/IEC 27001 standards, providing advanced access control and encryption.
- **Network Auditing:**  
  Leverage SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor for periodic audits of network performance and generate compliance reports.
- **Data Protection:**  
  Ensure all critical data is transmitted and stored with encryption, adhering to data protection regulations and industry best practices.
